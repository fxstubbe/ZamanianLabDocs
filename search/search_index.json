While most of our plotting and some data analysis uses R, our image and video analyses use Python. There are certain similarities to these languages, and most bioinformatic data analyses can be performed using one or the other (or both). However, R development is more streamlined and centralized, and we only use a few third-party packages, while Python includes two major versions (2 and 3) that are still regularly used (I write in Python 3 while many developers still prefer Python 2, and scripts written in one version often won't work when run with the other version), and the packages that we use are diverse and maintained by a large crowd of different developers. Thus, we don't need package and environment management for R, but our Python pipelines are greatly enhanced with such management. conda has several features that make it a powerful tool, but the main feature we will be using is the ability to create virtual environments and install packages to that specific environment. Normally, when you install a piece of software, it is available to run from any directory on your machine. This is good for some software, but sometimes a developer will encourage you to update the software, which inevitably breaks your code and makes debugging extremely difficult. Virtual environments are one solution to this problem. In these cases, instead of installing software to the entire machine, you install it only in a discrete, contained environment. Below are instructions on installing and setting up conda, and a representative example of how virtual environments work. Installation There are two flavors of conda - Anaconda and Miniconda. Anaconda is 3 GB and contains quite a few packages and features that are unnecessary for our purposes. wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-3.7.0-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh bash ~/miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME /miniconda These commands will download the miniconda installer, run it, and install it to your $HOME folder. It will also add the path /Users/[user]/software/miniconda3/bin to your lookup $PATH , which allows you to run conda executables without referring explicitly to their location. Usage and an Example Now that conda is installed, let's look at how virtual environments work. First, let's create a new environment that uses Python 3.5: conda create --name test_environment python=3.5 The environment has now been created. You can see a list of all the environments that you have ever created with conda env list . Here is a list of current environments on my machine (the asterisk marks the current environment): zamanian-3108:~ njwheeler$ conda env list # conda environments: # base * /Users/njwheeler/software/miniconda3 motility_analysis /Users/njwheeler/software miniconda3/envs/motility_analysis To activate the test_environment that you just created: source activate test_environment Now you are in the virtual environment, using Python 3.5 as a default. You can check to make sure this is the case with python --version . You can also see the path to your environment's Python with which python . Now that you are in the correct environment, you can begin adjusting it to suit your purposes. The main way to do this is by installing certain Python packages that you may use in your analysis. There are multiple ways to install a Python package, but the two main ways are using conda install {package name} and pip install {package name} . When installing a new package, you should first try to use the conda package manager. If that doesn't work, you will receive an error such as: PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels If you receive this error, use Google to try to find a way to install the package with conda. You may need to use a different channel such as bioconda , and then use conda install --channel bioconda {package name} . If the package is not available via conda, you will need to use pip install {package name} . As an example, we will use conda to install numpy. Numpy is a popular package used for scientific computing, typically computing that involve matrices. First make sure you are in the correct environment, then run: conda install numpy You should receive a message reporting the successful installation of the package. You can ensure successful installation by running Python with python and then attempting to load the package with >>> import numpy as np . If the package was successfully loaded, you will get no message. If it was unsuccessful, you will see: ModuleNotFoundError : No module named 'numpy' To demonstrate the utility of the conda virtual environment, first deactivate the test_environment with source deactivate test_environment . Then repeat the commands python and >>> import numpy as np . If done correctly, you will see that numpy isn't available outside of the test_environment . This way you can keep your base environment clean from unnecessary packages, and you can make sure the packages within a given environment aren't updated unless you explicitly make it so. Zamanian Lab Environments Whenever we begin a new analysis that will include Python scripts, it is the developer's responsibility to build a conda environment that is suitable for those scripts. Instructions for creating this environment should be included in the README file on the mainpage of the GitHub repo. See Nic's BrugiaMotilityAnalysis repo as an example.

Lab Mission and Philosophy A. Research Mission The central ambition of our laboratory is to combine molecular biology, genetics, and computational approaches to improve our understanding of helminth (parasitic worm) biology and our ability to treat globally important human and animal parasitic infections. This includes discovering new drug targets, elucidating mechanisms of drug resistance, and developing new tools for parasite manipulation. Our current work involves the study of mosquito-borne and soil-transmitted nematode parasites, as well as snail (vector) biology in relation to schistosome control. To complement some of our efforts, we exploit the experimental tractability of the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans . We strive to place all of our work in the context of a growing appreciation for and understanding of parasite genetic diversity. B. Philosophy We look to recruit individuals who share our curiosity and who wish to challenge themselves as they grow their scientific independence. We welcome students and trainees from a variety of backgrounds and with different career ambitions. I take my role as a mentor and advisor very seriously and it is therefore important to me that all members of the lab: (1) remain excited about the science we do, (2) challenge themselves to improve their base of knowledge and technical skills, and (3) engage in meaningful self-reflection about their progress and goals. Axioms: Borrowing from Federico Ardila-Mantilla, we build our lab upon these axioms: Axiom 1. Scientific \u201ctalent\u201d is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries. Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering scientific experiences. Axiom 3. Science is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs. Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. C. Mentorship We will hold weekly lab meetings as a springboard for open and critical scientific exchange. I will also schedule regular individual meetings with every member of the lab so that we can discuss research progress and whatever else that may arise. Career development is a multi-faceted endeavor. Where I am positioned to do so, I will identify or help create opportunities that relate to the career aspirations of individual lab members. I will work with trainees to help them hone their scientific writing and communication skills. This will occur through the drafting of manuscripts, as well as the attendance of relevant conferences. Once lab members have a firm grasp of their primary research projects, I will often encourage them to move out of their comfort zones. For many, this may mean achieving fluency in a programming language (e.g., R or Python) useful to their research and future. Lab members should also seek to make use of the expertise of the broader lab and university community. In general, your resources should include a wide network of peers and mentors. Foster relationships with others in your same position and those that are willing to offer advice. It is critical in science to foster your own support network of people you trust, are inspired by, and that have expertise you don\u2019t yet have. D. Lab Citizenship My commitment to your success in research and professional growth is coupled to certain expectations. I expect all members of the lab to take ownership of their projects. I expect members of the lab to lend their help and expertise to one another and understand that our laboratory is a team with common scientific goals. I expect everyone to display good lab citizenship. We place value in an open, collaborative, and safe scientific environment. We expect all members of the lab to be good lab citizens and to follow basic lab rules. 1. Do not borrow things without asking 2. Keep your own items to your own bench space 3. Use your own pipettes, tips, and gloves (except where designated) 4. Use only your assigned spaces in fridges and freezers 5. Follow all the rules in this guide for ordering and inventorying items 6. Carry out your lab tasks in a timely manner 7. Be helpful to others - this is a team effort! 8. Clean up after yourselves and put things back in assigned locations 9. Keep track of items we are low on and place orders in advance 10. Follow all the rules when interacting with other spaces (e.g., the insectary) 11. Stay ahead of parasite orders and plan their use accordingly 12. Be here during normal work hours so that you can maximize interactions 13. Make sure the lab is properly shut down (communicate before leaving) Lab dress code: For your safety, wear long pants or skirts and closed toed shoes, and tie back long hair. Do not wear shorts, short skirts, sandals, loose clothing, or dangling jewelry. Throughout your scientific career, you will be professionally interacting with people from diverse backgrounds and with diverse beliefs. In the interests of maintaining an inclusive and welcoming lab environment, I ask that you refrain from wearing articles of clothing that are likely to be perceived as hostile to another person\u2019s heritage, ethnicity, gender, religious beliefs, or sexuality. II. Communication and Calendar A. Slack All members of the lab will be asked to install Slack on their computers and phones and will receive an invitation to join the official lab Slack team zamanian-lab.slack.com . Slack will provide a basis for rapid individual and group communication on all research and lab-related matters. B. Google Calendar An official lab Google calendar will be shared and updated with lab meeting times, relevant departmental events, and one-on-one meeting times. Lab members who will be out of town should notify me in advance and mark those dates on the lab calendar so that other lab members are aware should anything arise. Approved vacation days and other time off should also be entered into the lab calendar. III. Research Documentation A. Physical Lab Notebooks All members of the lab should still record the details of their daily research activities in the form of a traditional lab notebook with dated entries. This is a requirement for federally-funded research. Lab notebooks cannot leave the laboratory and must be turned in at the conclusion of your tenure in the lab. B. Electronic Lab Notebooks The laboratory uses Benchling as a shared electronic lab notebook (ELN) and central repository for all molecular biology efforts. Lab members will receive an invitation to join the ZamanianLab Benchling organization page. Electronic summaries of work done and data generated (gels and printouts) should be regularly annotated and recorded into your defined Benchling lab notebook project space. This means that your electronic notes should include the minimal set of notes required to repeat any molecular biology experiment that you have performed. Do not let too much time elapse before you convert your physical notes into electronic form, as it is easier to clear up ambiguities when experiments are fresh in memory. This should develop into a habit. Benchling also provides tools for the planning of molecular cloning tasks and the design of molecular biology reagents. C. Lab Electronic Storage All grad students and postdocs should install the Box Drive application and receive an invitation to edit the ZamanianLab shared Box folder. All students and staff of the University of Wisconsin-Madison receive Box cloud storage at no cost through their university e-mail accounts. The shared folder will be used to store lab protocols in a common format and reading materials and resources relating to our research. DO NOT delete shared folders while your local computer is set to sync as this will delete data across all devices. Do not use spaces in file names, unnecessarily long file names, or vague file naming systems that obscure contents. The primary storage folders are described below: /Data/ This folder should be used to neatly preserve original files and raw data output from various lab and campus instruments (e.g., subfolders /Gels/ , /Sanger/ , /qPCR/ , /Microscopy/ , /GPCR_assays/ , /RNAi_experiments/ , and /ISH/ ), as well as minimally processed 'big' data outputs (e.g., subfolders /Genomics/ and /RNAseq/ ). For the former, create a folder with your first name and save files and images using the date (format: YYYYMMDD ) at the beginning of the file name. Other subfolders will be created to represent different project-specific data types where necessary, with strict guidelines for file nomenclature. /LabMembers/ Individual lab folders are provided for members of the lab to store their research-related documents. These individual folders should be used to preserve processed data, protocols in the process of optimization, writing (manuscripts, fellowships, and grants), and any computer programs or scripts written to carry out preliminary analyses. D. Lab Meetings Lab meetings will be held once a week. Every member of the lab should have an updated presentation file (dated YYYYMMDD ) in their personal /LabMeetings/ subfolder. This presentation should contain your overall project goals, divided into sub-aims, as well as data and timelines for specific experiments completed and planned for the coming weeks. You should be prepared to present your progress in this short format every week when called upon. This is a space for all members of the lab to contribute to troubleshooting and to engage in constructive and healthy scientific criticism. E. One-on-One Meetings I will hold weekly one-on-meetings with every graduate student and postdoc, except when I'm traveling or have other commitments that I cannot sideline. You should come prepared with organized summaries of the status of your project(s), to share data you\u2019ve produced, and to outline your next set of planned experiments. Each trainee and I will share a Google Doc to keep track of weekly and long-term goals. We will use this time to troubleshoot and constructively dissect these data and plans. This is also an opportunity for us to discuss general issues and your career development goals. IV. Lab Tasks and Organization A. Lab Tasks Every member of the lab will be involved in scheduled lab maintenance in some capacity. This will include things like defined cleaning activities and making common buffers and reagents. Roles are divided between undergraduates and other lab staff: /LabTasks/ : UndergradTasks.pdf and StaffTasks.pdf B. Lab inventory The locations of all reagents and consumables will be stored on Quartzy . Lab members will be expected to return ALL items to their assigned locations after use. It is the responsibility of lab members to make sure the Quartzy inventory is up-to-date. Additional rules are outlined in subsequent sections for inventory of plasmids, bacteria, worm strains, and parasite materials. C. General Lab Ordering Lab order requests should be made through Quartzy. Lab orders will be reviewed and placed by the lab manager. It is the responsibility of every member of the lab to communicate when we are nearing the end of necessary supplies or reagents so that orders can be placed in a timely manner. All oligo order requests should be placed through the relevant spreadsheets in the lab /LabOrdering/Oligos/ Box folder. All other consumables and reagent orders should be placed through Quartzy. Except for routine items (e.g., tips, tubes, and gloves), you should message the PI on Slack prior to placing an order on Quartzy to receive approval. Each request should be associated with a funding source in the Quartzy order form. Orders will be fulfilled on designated days of each week. When items arrive, they should be immediately marked as received, physically dated, and immediately associated with a location on Quartzy. D. General Lab Organization Locations Rm 235: consumables storage, 4C plate/media storage, liquid N2 stocks Rm 223: parasite and cell culture, plate pouring, glassware, and cleaning Rm 230: molecular biology main lab Rm 229D: microinjection room Third floor: offices, gel imaging station, insectary Operations: Benches and Pipettes will be assigned to each grad student and postdoc. Undergraduates should only use the spaces and pipettes of their lab mentor. Place dirty glassware in assigned sink locations (Rms 223 and 230). Place empty pipette boxes in assigned sink location (Rm 230). Place worm boxes for baking in assigned location (Rm 223). Empty shipping boxes should be placed on the ground outside the lab. Physical storage: Each graduate student and postdoc will have their own rack spaces in the -20C and -80C freezers for personal storage of materials related to individual experiments. Each person is responsible for maintaining proper labeling and notes of their stored items. There are designated storage spaces for lab and commercial plasmids, various bacterials stocks, C. elegans strain stocks, and parasite materials across lab freezers. V. Lab Stocks Locations and descriptions of all lab worm strains, plasmids, bacteria, and oligos should be stored and updated on Quartzy and in defined spreadsheets where specified. The following protocols and naming conventions must be followed, and lab members are responsible for checking the lab database to avoid naming conflicts prior to placing any new orders and assigning new names. Bacteria, worm strains, and plasmids procured from external sources and with existing names should retain those names. A. Oligos Oligo Naming: oMZ#### Storage box labels (-20C): \"Oligo Stocks #\" Use IDT_oligos.xls in /LabOrdering/Oligos/ to enter oligo details for ordering. Check Quartzy to ensure you are using the next oligo number available. Provide complete information ( Species , Oligo Pairing , Molecular Target , Amplicon Length , and Tm ) within the spreadsheet order form. All oligo types (DNA primers, gRNAs) should be assigned an ID with the same naming convention. Orders will be placed by a designated lab member. Primers: Make 100 uM lab stocks of each primer oligo and store in Oligo Stocks box (-20C). Add 10*Y (uL) volume to lyophilized primer, where Y is nmol yield to make 100 uM stocks. Keep 10 uM (1:10 of stock) dilutions of primers in your own personal boxes for personal use. Re-order the original stock primer before it runs out. B. Lab and Commercial Plasmids Lab Plasmids are plasmids created or designed by our lab for long-term use and storage. Commercial (external) Plasmids are plasmids we have received as gifts or ordered from vendors. Lab Plasmid inventory Plasmid Naming: pMZ#### Storage box labels (-80C & -20C): \"Lab Plasmids #\" Tube Counts: 1 copy (-80C) + 1 or more copies (-20C) Tube Labels: pMZ####, Concentration, and Date Commercial Plasmid inventory Plasmid Naming: Original Name Storage box labels (-80C & -20C): \"Commercial Plasmids #\" Tube Counts: 1 copy (-80C) + 1 or more copies (-20C) Tube Labels: Original Name, Concentration, and Date Update Quartzy with the exact -80C location of all plasmids and antibiotic resistance information. Use the stock(s) in -20C for all molecular biology purposes. When -20C stocks have been depleted, transfer the backup stock from -80C to -20C, and inoculate liquid media with the frozen bacterial stock to replace the plasmid stock in -80C. All intermediary vectors using for cloning that are unlikely to be used for other purposes should be stored in personal boxes until no longer needed. Plasmids note: All completed (inventoried) plasmid sequences should be deposited into the designated lab plasmid Benchling project. Additionally, plasmid sequences and image maps should be exported to the Box folder /LabInventory/Plasmid_Export/ . C. Transformed Bacteria Storage box labels (-80C & N2): \"Lab Plasmid Bacterial Stock #\" and \"Commercial Plasmid Bacterial Stock #\" Tube Counts: 2 copies (-80C) + 1 copy (N2) Tube Labels: Plasmid Name, Bacteria (eg., DH5a), and Date Each Lab and Commercial Plasmid should have three bacterial glycerol stocks made (see: PreparationOfBacterialFrozenStocks.pdf in /Protocols/General/ ). Additional labeling instructions can be found in /Protocols/FreezerLabels/ . Update Quartzy with the Location, Date frozen, Number of units (tubes), Genotype, and Antibiotic resistance. D. C. elegans Bacterial Stocks Boxes specific to each bacteria (e.g., OP50, HB101, NA22) used for C. elegans feeding should be stored in the designated area of the -80C, noted with how many tubes of each bacteria per box in Quartzy. Replace all bacterial stocks before using up the -80C stock. E. Competent Bacterial Stocks Boxes specific to each competent bacteria (DH5a, JM101) should be stored in the designated area of the -80C, noted with how many tubes of each bacteria per box in Quartzy. Replace all bacterial stocks before using up the -80C stock. VI. Caenorhabditis elegans Strains A. Strain Creation Only the lab manager (Kathy) is allowed to use the microinjection apparatus to create transgenic strains. It will be the responsibility of any person who wishes for a strain to be made to: 1. Coordinate with Kathy at least two weeks in advance 2. Provide necessary background strain for injection (if not N2) 3. Provide injection mixes in the Plasmids box in the top freezer in room 223 - Mark the tube with the date and all plasmids included in the mix - Including any fluorescent or phenotypic marker that should be followed 4. Provide all required information in the inventory spreadsheet (see below) It is your responsibility to monitor injected lines and select for stable lines and confirming genotypes (through PCR and other approaches). Provide Kathy with the F1 plates to chunk from and cryogenically preserve once you have decide to keep any transgenic lines. B. Strain Inventory Lab strain designation: ZAM# Lab allele designation: maz# C. elegans strains we receive from CGC, as gifts from other labs, or that we create in the lab will be frozen by the lab manager. Five tubes will be frozen at once, with one of those tubes frozen in the Liquid Nitrogen Tank. Strains must be associated with COMPLETE genotypic information (e.g., Transgenes, Alleles, Strain Background) on Quartzy AND in the C. elegans Strain Database linked in Lab Sheets . C. Strain Maintenance Maintain strains in your assigned areas of the 15/20C incubators, or above your bench if incubating at ambient temperature. Use assigned colors to label your plate boxes. Wrap old plates and dispose of contaminated plates regularly. Your contaminated plates (bacteria, fungi, or mites) can jeopardize the experiments of others! Request chunks or frozen strains from the lab manager with adequate notice. Strains should be re-thawed or chunked at least once every six months to avoid mutation accumulation. Update the Rm 230 whiteboard with the strains you are actively maintaining. Boxes should be baked before using them to propagate new strains. VII. Parasite and Insectary Operations A. Parasite Delivery Schedule We receive regular shipments of filarial parasites ( B. malayi , B. pahangi , and D. immitis ) from the NIH FR3 repository and supplement these with local infections. The Lab Manager will place external orders for many months ahead and the expected scheduling of all parasite stage and materials will be updated on the Parasite Schedule Sheet linked in Lab Sheets . Shipments do not always arrive as expected, but you should have a detailed list of future parasite needs on the spreadsheet . I will send out a FedEx confirmation once I receive it (typically one day in advance) in the #Parasite_Planning Slack channel. B. Storage of General Parasite Materials General use (non-experimental) parasite materials should be catalogued and stored in designated racks/boxes. There are individual boxes for B. malayi , B. pahangi, and D. immitis tissues and RNA in the -80C freezer. There is a single box for storage of parasite gDNA in the -20C freezer. The contents of all samples in these boxes should be inventoried for each species in the appropriate tab of the Parasite Tissue and Nucleic Acid Inventory sheet linked in Lab Sheets . Tissue tube label: Species, Stage, Date frozen, Number of worms RNA/gDNA tube label: Species, Stage, Date of extraction, Concentration Each files has three sheets (Tissue, RNA, and gDNA). The spreadsheets should be filled out with additional information, including the origin of the parasites, the method of RNA or DNA extraction, and the method used to spec purity and concentration. The spreadsheet should be immediately updated after placing any new tubes in these boxes. This catalog of materials allows us to plan qPCR, RNA-seq and other experiments. C. Parasite Infections (Insectary) The Bartholomay Lab insectary is a powerful resource that comes with major responsibilities. All members of the lab should follow established safety protocols and basic lab etiquette when using this space. No member of the lab should carry out insectary operations and procedures without approval from both PIs. Detailed protocols for filarial parasite infection and L3 isolation can be found on our Protocols page. Mosquito strains available for parasite infection: Ae. aegypti LVP strain: used for B. malayi and B. pahangi infections Ae. aegypti SD strain: used for D. immitis infections Strains must be ordered in advance for infection. Expect a minimum of 1 L3 per infected mosquito. Keep in mind that ~20% may not blood-feed and ~20-50% may die off before extraction, which is not uncommon with high parasite burden. Information on active and planned mosquito infections can be found in: /Infections/ : LocalInfectionSchedule.xlsx VIII. Writing and Reference Management To streamline collaborative writing and/or editing of manuscripts and fellowship applications, lab members should create Google Docs to share documents with me and others involved in the writing goal. Paperpile will be used to manage references. Paperpile is compatible with Google Docs. A lab license will be made available to those who require it. For those who prefer LaTeX over traditional word processing, OverLeaf is also an acceptable alternative to Google Docs. All final data, figures, scripts, and text associated with manuscript submissions should be organized within /Manuscripts/ . IX. Lab Safety All lab members must take the appropriate safety training before starting any lab work and to use appropriate PPE at all times. As a starting point, all lab members should register for and complete the course titled \"Biosafety Required Training\" through the Learn@UW portal. Lab biosafety protocols and procedures will also be provided in binder and electronic form ( /LabSafety/ ). In the event of emergencies involving accident or injury, call 911 to be routed to the campus police. E-mail both the Bartholomay and Zamanian lab list-servs (bartlab at lists.wisc.edu and zamanianlab at lists.wisc.edu) in advance of BSL2 work in the insectary space. Put up BSL-2 signs on doors and include location, time, and reminder for PPE. Example e-mail: \"I will be performing bulk parasite extractions from infected LVP mosquitoes TOMORROW (27/11/18). I will be performing the extractions in the screened-in work space inside the insectary (room 322). The parasites I will be extracting are Brugia pahangi L3s, and are classified as a BSL-2 organism. I will be working from 9:30AM - 12:30 PM, and will have signs posted on the outside of the screened-in area. If you need to enter this area during this time, please mind the PPE requirements specified on the posted BSL-2 signs. If this is a conflict/problem for anybody, please contact me as soon as possible. Thank you.\"","title":"Lab Manual"},{"location":"labmanual/#zamanian-lab-manual-v-20","text":"","title":"Zamanian Lab Manual v 2.0"},{"location":"labmanual/#i-lab-mission-and-philosophy","text":"","title":"I.

This includes discovering new drug targets, elucidating mechanisms of drug resistance, and developing new tools for parasite manipulation. Our current work involves the study of mosquito-borne and soil-transmitted nematode parasites, as well as snail (vector) biology in relation to schistosome control. To complement some of our efforts, we exploit the experimental tractability of the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans . We strive to place all of our work in the context of a growing appreciation for and understanding of parasite genetic diversity.","title":"A.

Axioms: Borrowing from Federico Ardila-Mantilla, we build our lab upon these axioms: Axiom 1. Scientific \u201ctalent\u201d is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries. Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering scientific experiences. Axiom 3.

I will also schedule regular individual meetings with every member of the lab so that we can discuss research progress and whatever else that may arise. Career development is a multi-faceted endeavor. Where I am positioned to do so, I will identify or help create opportunities that relate to the career aspirations of individual lab members. I will work with trainees to help them hone their scientific writing and communication skills. This will occur through the drafting of manuscripts, as well as the attendance of relevant conferences. Once lab members have a firm grasp of their primary research projects, I will often encourage them to move out of their comfort zones. For many, this may mean achieving fluency in a programming language (e.g., R or Python) useful to their research and future. Lab members should also seek to make use of the expertise of the broader lab and university community. In general, your resources should include a wide network of peers and mentors. Foster relationships with others in your same position and those that are willing to offer advice.

Freezing Worms Pick worms to six 6 cm plates you wish to freeze for each strain. For most strains, 4-6 plates is enough. For sick strains, more plates will result in a higher titter and therefore a better thaw rate. Check the genotype of the strain so you can follow any phenotypes to make sure the animals are correct. Store the plates at the optimal temperature for your strain (20\u00b0C for most strains) until the 6 cm plates are starved. The strain is ready to freeze when there is no bacteria on the plate and there are few or no embryos remaining on the plate. Most of the animals should be L1 or L2. Prepare the number of cryovial tubes (Room 223, Shelf 2) with cryo-safe labels (Printed on Label maker) with the appropriate information (e.g. - strain name, date frozen) that you want to freeze. Use \"Cryovials Label Template\" for printing labels with the correct information. We currently freeze six cryovial tubes per strain: four for our working stocks, one for long-term liquid nitrogen storage and one to use as a test thaw. For freezing transgenic strains the lab creates: freeze five tubes per independent line of that strain. Three for working stocks in the -80\u00b0C, one for liquid nitrogen storage, and one to use as a test thaw. When the last tube is thawed, you must re-freeze the strain. Get an ice bucket. Heat the Freezing Buffer (Peggy's recipe) in the microwave very slowly, checking every 30 seconds to see if it is melted. Put it in a 50 degree water bath until ready to use. Loosen the lids of all the cryovials. With a serological pipet, take about 6.5 mL of M9 for six 6 cm plates and dispense on the first six cm plate. Wash the worms off the plate. Using the same serological pipet, continue to wash worms off from all the plates. Put 1 mL of worms and M9 solution in each cryovial. Less volume can be added to the test thaw cryovial but remember how much was added for the addition of the Freezing Buffer step. Put cryovials with worms on ice for 5 min. Start a timer to check elapsed time of worms on ice. Add an equal amount of Freezing Buffer as M9 buffer per tube. This will be 1 mL except maybe for the test thaw tube. Vortex the cryovial. Then put the cryovials back on ice for 5 min. The elapsed time for adding the freezing buffer and vortexing should be about 5-6 min. Place tubes in a 1.5 mL tube styrofoam container in the -80\u00b0C. Cover the 1.5 mL tube styrofoam container with the lid and secure with a rubber band. Make sure to enter the strain in the \"Worms\" database in Quartzy. After a week or so, a test thaw can be done. Use the small styrofoam carton in the bottom of the -80\u00b0C with a metal block on dry ice to hold your agar frozen worm strains. Take the cryovial that needs to be thawed and place it in the metal block for transport to the bench. Rub the vial between your palm for 2 seconds. Heat a metal spatula in a flame and rotate around the outside of the cryovial until you can get a chunk free to place on a 10 cm plate. Place the chunk on the outer edge of the plate. Keep the melted worms to the outside of the plate as you want them to crawl into the OP50. Put the cryovial back into -80\u00b0C along with the metal block. Put the plate at the desired temperature for the worm strain. Check the plate after ~48-72 hr. If you see gravid animals and embryos on the plate, the strain survived the thaw. If you do not see gravid animals and embryos, try freezing the strain again, but start with more 6 cm plates (Step 1). If the strain has a transgenic marker, check to see if the thawed stock still expresses the marker. Move four tubes to the next available position in the Worm Stock Boxes (check Quartzy for the last strain put in position), move one tube to the next available position in the Liquid Nitrogen Stock boxes (check Quartzy). Put a space in between each strain that you freeze. If the strain information is not already in Quartzy, make sure to enter that information (any plasmids/ genotypes of the strain, where we got the strain, if it was lab-made or received from another lab or the CGC, growing temperature, etc.). After the tubes have been to the final Worm Stock and Liquid Nitrogen Stock positions (Step 12), indicate that information for that strain in Quartzy (and how many are in stock). Thawing and Cleaning Worms Use the small styrofoam carton in the bottom of the -80\u00b0C with a metal block on dry ice to hold your agar frozen worm strains. Take the cryovial that needs to be thawed and place in the metal block for transport to the bench. Rub the vial between palms for 2 seconds.

Keep the melted worms to the outside of the plate as you want them to crawl into the OP50. Put cryovial back into -80\u00b0C along with the metal block. Delete the appropriate tube form the Worm Stock Box database in Quartzy. If there is bacterial contamination: Once there are gravid animals on the 10 cm plate, bleach the animals to clean any bacterial contaminants: Place 15 \u03bcL of bleach solution (recipe below) on the edge of a labeled 6 cm plate. Place a minimum of 6 gravid animals into the bleach (10-15 animals is good). The bleach should dissolve the cuticle of the adult worms, releasing the embryos. Leave the plate lid-side up until all the bleach has soaked into the plate. After the bleach has soaked in, move the plate, lid-side down, to the optimal temperature for the worms. After ~24 hr., move L1s from the bleach plate to 4 separate clean, labeled 6 cm plates. You want between 10-20 L1s per plate - the more, the better.

Keep the melted worms to the outside of the plate as you want them to crawl into the OP50. Put cryovial back into -80\u00b0C along with the metal block. Delete the appropriate tube form the Worm Stock Box database in Quartzy. If there is bacterial contamination: Once there are gravid animals on the 10 cm plate, bleach the animals to clean any bacterial contaminants: Place 15 \u03bcL of bleach solution (recipe below) on the edge of a labeled 6 cm plate. Place a minimum of 6 gravid animals into the bleach (10-15 animals is good). The bleach should dissolve the cuticle of the adult worms, releasing the embryos. Leave the plate lid-side up until all the bleach has soaked into the plate. After the bleach has soaked in, move the plate, lid-side down, to the optimal temperature for the worms. After ~24 hr., move L1s from the bleach plate to 4 separate clean, labeled 6 cm plates. You want between 10-20 L1s per plate - the more, the better.","title":"Thawing and Cleaning Worms"},{"location":"protocols/Caenorhabditis_elegans/Freezing_Worms_Agar/Freezing_Worms_Agar/#reagent-recipes","text":"","title":"Reagent Recipes"},{"location":"protocols/Caenorhabditis_elegans/Freezing_Worms_Agar/Freezing_Worms_Agar/#m9-different-from-m9-in-lab-recipe-book","text":"Mix the following reagents: Reagent Amount Needed KH 2 PO 4 6 g Na 2 HPO 4 12 g NaCl 10 g dH 2 O up to 2 L Autoclave on liquid cycle for 30 min.

Label the bottle with a piece of tape stating: The type of media and final volume (e.g. NGM-1 L) or NGM-2 L), date of preparation, and your initials. NGM recipe: Reagent 1 L 2 L Peptone 2.5g 5 g NaCl 3 g 6 g Agar 17 g 34 g Sterile water 975 mL 1950 mL Note: if pouring NGMA plates, add 7 g of Agarose and 10 g of Agar per 1 L of media. Combine all reagents in a flask that can hold 2X the volume of your media. a. Put a plastic funnel in the mouth of the flask. b. Dump the contents of the bottle into the flask. c. Pour sterile water into the bottle and swirl to get any powder reagents off the sides. d. Pour the water from the bottle into the flask, making sure to rinse any powder stuck on the funnel into the flask. e. Repeat steps c and d until you've poured in all the sterile water. Cover the mouth of the flask with foil and tape in place with autoclave tape (autoclave room). Use label tape to label the flask with: media (e.g. NGM or HGM), date of pour, and your initials. NOTE: you can simply move the tape label from the plastic bottle to the flask, making sure to also write the date of pour on the label. Add stir bar. Autoclave the following with a 60 min. liquid cycle: a. 500 mL H 2 O in a 500 mL bottle. b. Liquid dispenser hoses capped and wrapped with aluminum foil. c. NMG or HGM media. Turn on the water baths in lab room 230 and set temperature to 55\u00b0C while the media is still in the autoclave. Once sterilization of media is complete, bring the flask to the lab and allow it to cool to 55\u00b0C in the water bath for at least an hour (maximum of four hr.) and then add the following to the media in the exact order listed . Gently swirl to mix after addition of each reagent. Reagent 1 L 2 L 1 M KH 2 PO 4 (K Phosphate Buffer) 25 mL 50 mL Cholesterol (5 mg/mL in Ethanol) 1 mL 2 mL 1 M CaCl 2 1 mL 2 mL 1 M MgSO 4 1 mL 2 mL If these solutions are already made, make sure they are autoclaved (except Cholesterol) or filter-sterilized before adding to the media. Number of plates poured per volume of NGM: 1 L of NGM 2 L of NGM ~60 6 cm plates ~160 6 cm plates ~40 10 cm plates ~60 10 cm plates ## Operating the PourBoy Things you will need to autoclave before PourBoy use: - PourBoy input and output tube: wrap the tube openings with foil, then fold the tubes up and wrap both tubes together in foil. Place autoclave tape on the wrapping. 1 L sterile water (for cleaning of the PourBoy prior to use) Once autoclaved, remove foil from one end of one of the tubes (tube 1) and connect that end to the input port (refer figure), then remove foil from one end of the other tube (tube 2) and connect that end to the output port. Run 200 mL of hydrogen peroxide through the PourBoy. Check PourBoy settings. Use the \"POUR\" up and down buttons to set the volume that must be dispensed into each plate Press and release the \"MODE/CAL\" button to switch between Manual mode (dispenses once per foot pedal operation) and Auto mode (dispenses indefinitely, with a pause interval between dispensing operations). Use the \"PAUSE\" up and down buttons to increase and decrease the interval between dispensing operations in auto mode. Foot pedal is hard-wired to the PourBoy pump and you should not attempt to remove it. NOTE: Be very careful with the ends of the tubes from this point forward. They are sterile and must be kept sterile while pouring plates. Do not allow them to touch anything but the inside of the autoclaved media, water, or aluminum foil. Place the autoclaved bottle of water on the hot plate (setting \u2158). Remove the foil from the other end of tube 1 and lower the tube into autoclaved water (<100\u00b0C). Remove foil from the other end of tube 2 and hold over a plastic jug to collect dispensed water. Ensure that the tube does not touch the sides of the non-sterile jug. Use the foot petal to pass water through the tubes to sterilize the pump drive coil. Use a plastic receptacle (Shelf 5) as a waste container for water/media. Once you've passed ~300-400 mL of water, switch tube 1 to the flask with media (bring to room 223 from the water bath in room 230), kept on the hot plate. Once the tube is in the flask, cover the mouth of the flask with foil. Bring the water to the water bath. Wipe down the working area with 70% ethanol and then spread individual plates out on the table. While holding the lid of a plate open, move the dispensing end of tube 2 over the plate and use the foot pedal to dispense the set volume of media. Then move on to the next plate. Be sure not to touch the tip of the tubing onto any part of the plate. Throughout the plate pouring procedure, remember to watch the flask to ensure that the media is getting into the tubing even when there is only a small volume of media left in the flask. If the opening of the tubing is not completely covered by media, air will get into the tubing, which results in bubbles in the plates. Plates with bubbles are not usable. Tip the flask to the side to pour out the last few plates. Stop the pouring if there is not enough media left (less than the volume for one plate). Once the desired number of plates have been poured, switch tube 1 from the flask with 200 mL of hydrogen peroxide and run entire volume through. Then, switch to the bottle with hot water (switch the water with the media flask on the hot plate to heat up the water) and foot pedal 300-400 mL of water through the PourBoy to flush out media before it solidifies in the tubes and pump drive coil. Once all plates are solidified (~15 min. for 6 cm plates and ~30 min. for 10 cm plates) stack them up ( lid-side up ) and use labelling tape to label them with the name of media, name of the person that poured the plates, time, and date. Leave plates stacked on benchtop for two days. Place in a clean a plastic box wiped down with 70% ethanol (wipe down all sides of the box until dry). Then stack the poured plates in the box, lid-side down . Transfer the labelling tape form step 9 to the box. Store the box in the 4\u00b0C deli-style fridge. NOTE: When pouring many plates, there is not enough room on the bench to fit all of the plates in the media. To maximize space, you can stack 3-4 plates on top of each other and pour from the bottom up of each stack. When done with a stack, place the flask of media back in the 60\u00b0C water bath, and wait for the plates to dry (20-30 min.). Once dry, stack all of the plates on the right end of the bench and place out more stacks of plates to pour. Continue and repeat until all of the media has been poured.

Measure concentration and purity on the NanoDrop in room 311. a. This protocol results in very pure RNA, with 260:280 and 260:230 values between 1.9 and 2.2. Optional, remove contaminating genomic DNA with the Turbo DNase Free kit (find the protocol at ZamanianLab/Protocols/Kits_Manuals/TURBO_DNA-free.pdf). a. Note: DNase treatment is required if planning on performing qPCR, and is strongly suggested in all other cases, especially if the 260:280 values from the NanoDrop reading was <2. Perform a 1:5 dilution with a 1 \u03bcL sample and measure the concentration with Qubit RNA BR. a. Note: the linear range of the RNA BR assay is 1-1000 ng/\u03bcL, so use NanoDrop estimates to calculate the appropriate sample dilution. b. Note: if performing qPCR or other quantitative measurements, the Qubit assay is significantly more reliable than the NanoDrop, and any downstream calculations should incorporate the Qubit measurement. c.

Generally, \"Min\" is the best choice, but be careful not to change the reading frame if you are assembling a fusion protein. Repeat step 7 if you want to add spacers between other fragments (i.e., you want to generate new cut sites between fragments). Click Done to get the final assembly. Copy the \"Assembled Color-coded Sequence\" and import it into Benchling for markup and annotation.

If all is satisfactory, order the designed oligos. Be sure to include the 3\u2032 Tm and 3\u2032 Ta temperatures, as the 3\u2019 Ta will be used for the PCRs that generate the fragment. Assembly reactions Prior to assembly, generate all the fragments to be assembled - this may be by either synthesis, restriction digest of a plasmid, or PCR. Things to note: a. Restriction digest - ensure the digest completed by running an aliquot on a gel. In my experience, you do NOT need to gel purify the correct sized band - the off-target band will not impede the assembly. However, you DO need to inactivate the restriction enzymes. Some NEB enzymes can be heat inactivated at 65\u00b0C for 20 minutes, but check the specifications of the enzymes to be used. If you can\u2019t heat inactivate, you will need to purify using the PCR purification kit. b. PCR - use a high-fidelity polymerase from NEB, typically Q5. The polymerase you choose should correspond to the polymerase you selected when using the NEBuilder Assembly Tool. For these PCR reactions, do 25 \u03bcL reactions for 35 cycles, and use the Tm that the Assembly Tool provided (3\u2019 Ta). If the combined PCR products make up greater than \u2155 of the final assembly reaction, you should purify the PCR reactions. In general, it\u2019s probably better to purify. Thaw the reaction constituents on ice. Use the Qubit dsDNA BR kit to quantify every fragment. Calculate how the molar amount of each fragment to include.

In this case, I started with 50 ng of the backbone and calculated the number of pmols that would be based on the size of the cut fragment that would be assembled. I then multiplied that amount (0.023 pmol) by two to get the 2:1 vector:insert ratio. 0.046 pmol of the 1645 bp cel-osm-9p is 46.76 ng. c.

Follow the the RNA extraction protocol for C. elegans or parasites . Use the Invitrogen SuperScript III kit to perform first-strand cDNA synthesis. Do not freeze RNA in between extraction and first-strand synthesis; perform synthesis immediately after quantification. Include a non-experimental RNA sample that comes from the same species and stage as your experimental samples (I typically use stock RNA samples from the FR3). If performing relative transcript quantification, be sure to normalize the RNA input based on the Qubit quantification. Use a 1:1 mixture of oligo(dT) and random hexamer primers and create primer and enzyme master mixes to use across all samples. Perform the optional RNase H digestion to remove remaining single-stranded RNAs. Freeze at -20\u00b0C until ready for the qPCR. Before optimizing your primers, validate that they work and produce the expected amplicon length by performing normal PCR on a plasmid template and/or cDNA template. Book the qPCR machine (room 311) on the morning of the reaction. Primer optimization Primer stock dilutions qPCR primers must be optimized for each new RNA/cDNA template. Primer optimization involves primer dilutions to find the optimal primer concentration for each primer set + template combination. Depending on your experiments, you should probably use the same stage, non-experimental cDNA sample that is at the same concentration as your experimental samples (the best practice is to include this sample in your cDNA synthesis reaction). The PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix kit recommends trying 300, 500, and 800 nM final concentrations, but you can add additional (lower) concentrations as well. Use the table below to calculate qPCR primer stock concentrations: C f (qPCR primers, nM) V f</sub (qPCR Reaction) V i (Primer + Water Input) C i (Primer Input) 300 20 8 = 20 \u03bcL - 10 \u03bcL MM - 2 \u03bcL cDNA = A1 * B1 / C1 = 750 500 20 8 = 20 \u03bcL - 10 \u03bcL MM - 2 \u03bcL cDNA = A2 * B2 / C2 = 1250 800 20 8 = 20 \u03bcL - 10 \u03bcL MM - 2 \u03bcL cDNA = A3 * B3 / C3 = 2000 NOTE: volumes in D are calculated using a cDNA input of 2 \u03bcL and will need to be adjust for different inputs. Use a separate freezer box for qPCR primer and make a new 10 \u03bcM working stock that contains both the forward and the reverse primer. a. Add 20 \u03bcL of each primer and 160 \u03bcL water. Use the table below to calculate the dilutions for qPCR primer stocks. Add the appropriate volume of 10 \u03bcM working stock to water for a final volume of 50 \u03bcL. C f (qPCR primer stock, nM) V f</sub (qPCR Primer Stock) C i (Primer Stock) V i (Primer Stock Input) 750 50 10 = A1 / 1000 * B1 / C1 = 3.75 1250 50 10 = A2 / 1000 * B2 / C2 = 6.25 2000 50 10 = A3 / 1000 * B3 / C3 = 10 Plate setup Each qPCR experiment should contain a minimum of 5 ng RNA/cDNA (10 ng is preferable). If possible, each primer dilution should be run in duplicate. Use a non-experimental cDNA sample that has the same concentration and is from the same life stage as your experimental samples. Design the plate setup on Benchling (example below). a. If possible, do not add any reactions to the outer columns or rows to ensure no evaporation (though I have not run into evaporation problems regardless of well location). b. Keep the same primers next to each other on the plate. c. Be sure to include no-template negative controls to check for contamination in your primer stocks. Dilute an aliquot of the cDNA to 2.5 ng \u03bcL so that 2 \u03bcL input cDNA will make 5ng/qPCR (or dilute to half of the final mass so that you can add 2 \u03bcL to the reaction). Create primer + PowerUp SYBR Green master mixes by adding 10 \u03bcL PowerUp SYBR Green * (n + 1) + 8 \u03bcL primer dilution * (n + 1) to a single tube (one master mix per primer dilution). Put a qPCR plate on ice. Pipette 2 \u03bcL of the proper cDNA to the side wall of the well. a. This makes it easier to keep track of which well has had the cDNA added. b. Another strategy for keeping track of pipetting is arranging your pipette tip box such that you know exactly which tip will be the last one to be used. Add 18 \u03bcL of the proper master mix to the dot of cDNA and allows the mixture to fall to the bottom of the tube. Carefully seal the plate with sealing film. Spin the plate on the plate centrifuge. Examine the bottom of each well to ensure no bubbles remain. If there are bubbles, sharply flick the well until it pops. Respin the plate if necessary. Return the plate to ice and move to the qPCR machine in room 311. Thermocycler setup Touch the screen of the thermocycler to wake it up and press the on/off button to turn it on. Place the qPCR plate in the machine. Begin the StepOne v2.3 program and login as a guest. Click \u201cAdvanced Setup, which will open the following screen. Fill out the metadata and match the selections shown above. a. Experiment name should be the date of the run. b. Add your full name as the user name. c.

In the \u201cDefine Targets and Samples\u201d tab, add your targets and samples to the appropriate panes. For primer optimization runs, the \u201cSample Names\u201d should be the different primer dilutions (i.e. 300, 500, and 800). b. Ignore the \u201cBiological Replicates\u201d pane even if you have biological replicates. Click the \u201cAssign Targets and Samples\u201d tab. a. Design the plate in the same arrangement as designed on Benchling. Select a well or range of well and click the boxes next to the proper target and sample. b. Note: each experimental sample should also include the \u201cU\u201d task next to the target name. Before defining no-template negative controls in the plate layout (in this case, wells C1 and D1), click the \u201cN\u201d box in the Task section. Click the \u201cRun Method\u201d menu. a. Setup the thermocycler program according to the below screenshot. Changes that need to be made from the default program: i. A 2 minute, 50\u00b0C hold step needs to be added before the 95\u00b0 hold step in the Holding Stage. ii. The 95\u00b0 hold step should be changed to 2 minutes. iii. Based on your primers, you probably need to add a 3 rd step to the Cycling Stage. Adjust the 2 nd step to 15 seconds and the annealing temperature validated with the initial PCR used to test the primers on plasmid/cDNA template. Add a 3 rd step with a 1 minute, 72\u00b0C extension. Deselect the \u201cData Collection\u201d icon on the annealing step and select it on the extension step. iv. Change the Melt Curve Stage from \u201cStep and Hold\u201d to \u201cContinuous.\u201d v. Change the percentage of the ramp rate to 10%. When finished setting up the run, click \u201cStart Run\u201d (green button). Stay in the room until you confirm that the run has started. Primer optimization analysis After the run is complete, click the Analysis menu. a. You can quickly analyze the run in the StepOne program, but the lab also has an R script that allows for more customized analysis. On the thermocycler computer, click Export a. Chose all data files other than Multicomponent Data. b. Export to a .txt file type. c. Export to an external flash drive. Transfer the .txt file to ZamanianLab/Data/qPCR/Name/Date/ and copy the primer_optimization.R script to the directory. Once transferred, open the .txt file and manually edit it such that each section defined in [square brackets] is saved into its own file. When naming the files, add the date to the beginning of each file name, followed by an underscore. You should have the following files (file names should be the exact same, otherwise the analysis script won\u2019t work.) Make sure the [words in brackets] are removed from the files so that every line is tab-delimited. a. YEARMTDY_results.txt b. YEARMTDY_melt_region_derivative_data.txt c. YEARMTDY_melt_region_normalized_data.txt d. YEARMTDY_melt_region_temperature_data.txt e. YEARMTDY_amplification_data.txt f. YEARMTDY_raw_data.txt g. YEARMTDY_sample_setup.txt h. For instance, the header of each file should look something like this: Open RStudio. a. Navigate to File > New Project... b. Click Existing Directory. c. Click Browse... d. Navigate to the directory containing your qPCR data and click Open. e. Close RStudio. Open up your Terminal application. a. Navigate to your directory by amending the {name} and {date} sections of the command cd ZamanianLab/Data/qPCR/{Name}/{Date}/ b. Run the command Rscript primer_optimzation.R {Date} c. The script should produce two PDFs, amplification.pdf and melt_curves.pdf and it should print out the best primer concnetration for each sample. Examine the plot in melt_curves.pdf (left). a. The plot should contain 2 columns labeled Derivative and Value; these show the changes in fluorescence emitted at different temperatures during the melting of the last step of the Melt Curve stage. b. The plot should also contain a row for every target (i.e., primer set), and each panel should include a line for every well. c. Analysis of the melt curves will tell you if your primers are forming primer dimers or are amplifying off-target sequences. In order to continue with the qPCR experiment, your primer should include a single peak in the Derivative plot, corresponding to a single amplicon produced by the reaction. Primer dimers will correspond to peaks at low temperatures, and longer non-off target products will correspond to peaks at higher temperatures. d. Negative controls will not have a peak (because there should be no amplification). You will notice from the above plot that the negative controls for GAPDH and OSM-9 were correct, while it appears that there was contamination in the TAX-4 primers (every line contains a peak). Examine the plot in amplification.pdf (right). a. Again there will be a row for every target and a column for dRn and log10(dRn) b. In the dRn column, you should see a label and line marking each of the primer dilutions you included, along with the C T value. The dilution with the lowest C T , in this case 800 for all primer sets, should be used in qPCR using experimental samples. qPCR with experimental samples Based on the results of the primer optimization, create new primer dilutions at the optimized concentrations, this time ensuring you make enough of the qPCR primer stock for all of the reactions (use the tables above). Follow the Plate setup and Thermocycler setup sections above. a. When organizing the plate in Thermocycler setup step 6, use your different cDNAs instead of primer dilutions as the Sample Names. b. Run the exact same thermocyler program as you ran for primer optimization. qPCR analysis Follow steps 1 - 4 from Primer optimization analysis to export the reaction results as described. Transfer qpcr_analysis.R to the folder containing the data. Open qpcr_analysis.R in RStudio. Run lines 1 - 95 to create amplification.pdf and melt_curves.pdf . Examine the resulting images to check for on-target amplification and proper results for the negative controls. Run lines 100 - 127 to plot the C T values for each sample (using the mean from technical replicates). If performing \u0394\u0394C T calculations, you will have to manually edit lines 132 - 183.","title":"Two-Step qPCR"},{"location":"protocols/Molecular_Biology/qPCR/qPCR/#two-step-qpcr","text":"","title":"Two-Step qPCR"},{"location":"protocols/Molecular_Biology/qPCR/qPCR/#materials","text":"Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus (Zymo Research R2070S) SuperScript III (Thermo Fisher Scientific 18080051) PowerUp SYBR Green MasterMix (Fisher Scientific A25741) qPCR sub-skirted plate (MIDSCI AVT3890) Thermal sealing film (Excel Scientific TS-RT2RR-100)","title":"Materials"},{"location":"protocols/Molecular_Biology/qPCR/qPCR/#preparation","text":"Two-step qPCR starts with RNA that has been DNase-treated and quantified with NanoDrop.

Navigate to the directory containing your qPCR data and click Open. e. Close RStudio. Open up your Terminal application. a. Navigate to your directory by amending the {name} and {date} sections of the command cd ZamanianLab/Data/qPCR/{Name}/{Date}/ b. Run the command Rscript primer_optimzation.R {Date} c. The script should produce two PDFs, amplification.pdf and melt_curves.pdf and it should print out the best primer concnetration for each sample. Examine the plot in melt_curves.pdf (left). a. The plot should contain 2 columns labeled Derivative and Value; these show the changes in fluorescence emitted at different temperatures during the melting of the last step of the Melt Curve stage. b. The plot should also contain a row for every target (i.e., primer set), and each panel should include a line for every well. c. Analysis of the melt curves will tell you if your primers are forming primer dimers or are amplifying off-target sequences. In order to continue with the qPCR experiment, your primer should include a single peak in the Derivative plot, corresponding to a single amplicon produced by the reaction. Primer dimers will correspond to peaks at low temperatures, and longer non-off target products will correspond to peaks at higher temperatures. d. Negative controls will not have a peak (because there should be no amplification). You will notice from the above plot that the negative controls for GAPDH and OSM-9 were correct, while it appears that there was contamination in the TAX-4 primers (every line contains a peak). Examine the plot in amplification.pdf (right). a. Again there will be a row for every target and a column for dRn and log10(dRn) b. In the dRn column, you should see a label and line marking each of the primer dilutions you included, along with the C T value. The dilution with the lowest C T , in this case 800 for all primer sets, should be used in qPCR using experimental samples.","title":"Primer optimization analysis"},{"location":"protocols/Molecular_Biology/qPCR/qPCR/#qpcr-with-experimental-samples","text":"Based on the results of the primer optimization, create new primer dilutions at the optimized concentrations, this time ensuring you make enough of the qPCR primer stock for all of the reactions (use the tables above).

Screened-in room will need to be reserved and scheduled on the Google calendar Injection Schedule prior to BSL2 work. Before bringing out the mosquitoes from the insectary, place BSL2 signs on all entrances to the lab and to the screened dissection room. Put on lab coat, goggles and gloves. A.

Add 2.5 mL of Pen/Strep stock solution and 2.5 mL Gentamicin to each aliquot. Then separate the RPMI into 2 separate bottles. Place one bottle in the fridge or on ice to cool and the other in a 37\u00b0C incubator. Cold anesthetize the mosquitoes in the cartons (place the cartons in -20\u00b0C refrigerator for about 20-30 s., or until knocked down). You can put up to ~600 mosquitoes in the mortar, so combine the cartons as needed (2 cartons into 1 or 3 cartons into 2). When ready, quickly transfer, at once, all mosquitoes in the carton to the mortar. Using the pestle, gently tap the mosquitoes to disrupt the cuticle (use a tapping motion, not a grinding motion). Do not over tap; more is not better. Gently tap until only a few intact mosquitoes are remaining. Transfer the mosquitoes to the mesh strainer and place the strained into a Ziploc plastic dish containing cold RPMI (dish should be ~ half full of RPMI). Dip the strainer up and down 3-5 times to remove scales, eggs, etc (the RPMI should appear cloudy). Do not dip too much as you can lose the L3s in the strainer. Discard the RPMI and add clean cold RPMI to the dish (\u00bd full) and dip up and down 3-5x to further rinse the L3s in the strainer. Transfer the strainer of L3s to a clean second dish containing warm RPMI (40-50 mL, enough to cover the L3s) and incubate at 37\u00b0C for Brugia spp. or 39\u00b0C for Dirofilaria for 30 min. The incubation time will allow the L3s to migrate out of the strainer and into the warm RPMI. Remove strainer from dish and transfer all L3s into a Petri dish containing a small amount (~20 mL) of fresh, 37\u00b0C RPMI. Count the total number of L3s harvested and from how many mosquitoes crushed, and aliquot L3s as necessary. Once the extractions are complete, rinse and wash all materials used. Dispose of the used plates in the biohazard bin. Do not throw away the sieve or Ziploc dishes. They can be re-used. B.

On ice, place a large glass Petri dish lined with filter paper. Cold anesthetize the mosquitoes in the cartons (place the cartons in 4\u00b0C refrigerator until knocked down). Once knocked down, put mosquitoes on top of the filter paper in the Petri dish. Take a clean slide and in the center add a puddle of 1x Aedes saline using a transfer pipette. Using a dissecting probe or a forceps, transfer one adult female mosquito to the pool of saline. Using dissecting probes decapitate mosquito. You may notice L3 beginning to migrate out of the back of the head. Pierce the mosquito head with one probe and use another probe to cut the mosquito proboscis in half. This will allow the L3 to escape the mouth parts. Allow the dissected head and mouthparts to incubate in the saline for a few minutes, to allow all the L3 to migrate into saline. Once all L3 are in saline, individually transfer the L3 into the Petri dish containing the RPMI using a small worm hook (dissecting probe that has been curved into a small hook). Once all L3 have been transferred, place the dish of RPMI and L3 back on the warm plate and wipe off the slide with a Kimwipe. You can reuse the slide. Repeat the above process until all mosquitoes have been dissected or until enough L3 have been collected. If there are mosquitoes remaining, dump mosquitoes into an old mosquito carton and place in freezer. Discard spent tubes of media, Kimwipes and slides in the proper biohazard bins. Place Petri dish of L3 in the 37\u00b0C incubator until ready to use. Discard ice, take down BSL-2 signage, and ethanol work area and tools.","title":"Extraction of *Brugia* or *Dirofilaria* L3 from Infected Mosquitoes"},{"location":"protocols/Parasitic_Nematodes/L3_Extraction/L3_Extraction/#extraction-of-brugia-or-dirofilaria-l3-from-infected-mosquitoes","text":"General Note : If working with Brugia infected mosquitoes, all members of the Zamanian and Bartholomay lab need to be notified 24 hours in advance.

Place one bottle in the fridge or on ice to cool and the other in a 37\u00b0C incubator. Cold anesthetize the mosquitoes in the cartons (place the cartons in -20\u00b0C refrigerator for about 20-30 s., or until knocked down). You can put up to ~600 mosquitoes in the mortar, so combine the cartons as needed (2 cartons into 1 or 3 cartons into 2). When ready, quickly transfer, at once, all mosquitoes in the carton to the mortar. Using the pestle, gently tap the mosquitoes to disrupt the cuticle (use a tapping motion, not a grinding motion). Do not over tap; more is not better. Gently tap until only a few intact mosquitoes are remaining. Transfer the mosquitoes to the mesh strainer and place the strained into a Ziploc plastic dish containing cold RPMI (dish should be ~ half full of RPMI). Dip the strainer up and down 3-5 times to remove scales, eggs, etc (the RPMI should appear cloudy). Do not dip too much as you can lose the L3s in the strainer. Discard the RPMI and add clean cold RPMI to the dish (\u00bd full) and dip up and down 3-5x to further rinse the L3s in the strainer. Transfer the strainer of L3s to a clean second dish containing warm RPMI (40-50 mL, enough to cover the L3s) and incubate at 37\u00b0C for Brugia spp. or 39\u00b0C for Dirofilaria for 30 min. The incubation time will allow the L3s to migrate out of the strainer and into the warm RPMI. Remove strainer from dish and transfer all L3s into a Petri dish containing a small amount (~20 mL) of fresh, 37\u00b0C RPMI. Count the total number of L3s harvested and from how many mosquitoes crushed, and aliquot L3s as necessary. Once the extractions are complete, rinse and wash all materials used. Dispose of the used plates in the biohazard bin. Do not throw away the sieve or Ziploc dishes.

Remove 20 \u00b5L of infected blood and put it into 50 \u00b5L of dH2O on a slide and mix with a pipette tip. Place the slide on a compound scope and count the mf. Start at a corner of the cover slip and count the mf in the fluid outside of the coverslip. Once the perimeter has been counted, count the mf using an s-pattern. Calculate the mf number in the stock solution. Dilute the infected blood, using C 1 V 1 =C 2 V 2 to determine how much control blood (Defibrinated Sheep\u2019s Blood\u2014Hemostat Laboratories DSB100) to add to get the desired blood feeding concentration.

In these feeders carefully place ~10 mL of infected blood into the top of the blood feeders using a disposable pipet. You need to make sure that the feeders are level so that the blood doesn\u2019t pool in one side of the membrane since you want an even distribution of mf. Place a carton of mosquitoes under a membrane feeder and slowly lower the feeder so that it rests atop the carton and is flush with the mesh of the carton. Allow the carton of females to feed for 30 \u2013 45 min. or until a majority of females have fed. When feeding is complete, remove an aliquot of blood to confirm that the mf are still alive and active. Do not separate blood fed from non-blood fed mosquitoes at conclusion of feeding.
