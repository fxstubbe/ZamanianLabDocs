Introduction
============

This resource is both an introduction and documentation for the computational
aspects of the Zamanian Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Here you
will find a general explanation for how we organize our computational pipelines,
as well as steps to take to maintain cross-machine compatibility,
reproducibility, and a commitment to open source code.

Contents
========

There are four main tools we will use to accomplish the above goals:

#. `GitHub <https://github.com>`_
#. `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_
#. `Box Sync <https://box.com>`_
#. `conda <https://conda.io/docs/>`_

Usage
=====

This repository is primarily imagined as a first introduction to the Zamanian
Lab organization, but it can also be used as a reference for veteran users.
Throughout the docs, you will see certain types of code blocks. Code to be run
in bash will not include a prompt sequence, for instance:

``python L3_motility_analysis.py 20180830``

Code to be run in Python will include the Python prompt:

``>>> import numpy as np``

And code to be run in R will include the R prompt:

``> install.packages('tidyverse')``
